# urlshortner

This service makes transfering text and code easier and secure, as a bonus it also doubles down as a url shortner.
A registered user can sign in and enter Text/uploadtext files/paste in the text area and has the option to enter a key for encryption.
upon submission, a shortened url is generated, clicking the link takes the user to the frontend where the time and ip address is logged and the data is decryted if needed.
